 I The Science Behind Procrastination
Let s start by getting the basics nailed down What is procrastination What does procrastination mean What exactly are we dealing with here 
 What is Procrastination 
Human beings have been procrastinating for centuries The problem is so timeless in fact that ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle developed a word to describe this type of behavior Akrasia 
 Akrasia is the state of acting against your better judgment It is when you do one thing even though you know you should do something else Loosely translated you could say that akrasia is procrastination or a lack of self control 
 Here s a modern definition 
 Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing a task or set of tasks So whether you refer to it as procrastination or akrasia or something else it is the force that prevents you from following through on what you set out to do

 Why Do We Procrastinate 
Ok definitions are great and all but why do we procrastinate What is going on in the brain that causes us to avoid the things we know we should be doing 
 This is a good time to bring some science into our discussion Behavioral psychology research has revealed a phenomenon called time inconsistency which helps explain why procrastination seems to pull us in despite our good intentions Time inconsistency refers to the tendency of the human brain to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards 
 The best way to understand this is by imagining that you have two selves your Present Self and your Future Self When you set goals for yourself like losing weight or writing a book or learning a language you are actually making plans for your Future Self You are envisioning what you want your life to be like in the future Researchers have found that when you think about your Future Self it is quite easy for your brain to see the value in taking actions with long term benefits The Future Self values long term rewards 
 However while the Future Self can set goals only the Present Self can take action When the time comes to make a decision you are no longer making a choice for your Future Self Now you are in the present moment and your brain is thinking about the Present Self Researchers have discovered that the Present Self really likes instant gratification not long term payoff 
 So the Present Self and the Future Self are often at odds with one another The Future Self wants to be trim and fit but the Present Self wants a donut Sure everyone knows you should eat healthy today to avoid being overweight in years But consequences like an increased risk for diabetes or heart failure are years away 
 Similarly many young people know that saving for retirement in their s and s is crucial but the benefit of doing so is decades off It is far easier for the Present Self to see the value in buying a new pair of shoes than in socking away for year old you If you re curious there are some very good evolutionary reasons for why our brain values immediate rewards more highly than long term rewards 
 This is one reason why you might go to bed feeling motivated to make a change in your life but when you wake up you find yourself falling back into old patterns Your brain values long term benefits when they are in the future tomorrow but it values immediate gratification when it comes to the present moment today 
 The Procrastination Action Line
You cannot rely on long term consequences and rewards to motivate the Present Self Instead you have to find a way to move future rewards and punishments into the present moment You have to make the future consequences become present consequences 
 This is exactly what happens during the moment when we finally move beyond procrastination and take action For example let s say you have a report to write You ve known about it for weeks and continued to put it off day after day You experience a little bit of nagging pain and anxiety thinking about this paper you have to write but not enough to do anything about it Then suddenly the day before the deadline the future consequences turn into present consequences and you write that report hours before it is due The pain of procrastinating finally escalated and you crossed the Action Line 
 The Procrastination Action Line
 There is something important to note here As soon as you cross the Action Line the pain begins to subside In fact being in the middle of procrastination is often more painful than being in the middle of doing the work Point A on the chart above is often more painful than Point B The guilt shame and anxiety that you feel while procrastinating are usually worse than the effort and energy you have to put in while you re working The problem is not doing the work it s starting the work 
 If we want to stop procrastinating then we need to make it as easy as possible for the Present Self to get started and trust that motivation and momentum will come after we begin Motivation often comes after starting not before 
 Let s talk about how to do that now 
 II How to Stop Procrastinating Right Now
There are a variety of strategies we can employ to stop procrastinating Below I ll outline and explain each concept then I ll provide you with some examples of strategy in action 
 Option Make the Rewards of Taking Action More Immediate
If you can find a way to make the benefits of long term choices more immediate then it becomes easier to avoid procrastination One of the best ways to bring future rewards into the present moment is with a strategy known as temptation bundling 
 Temptation bundling is a concept that came out of behavioral economics research performed by Katy Milkman at The University of Pennsylvania Simply put the strategy suggests that you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long run with a behavior that feels good in the short run 
 The basic format is Only do THING YOU LOVE while doing THING YOU PROCRASTINATE ON 
 Here are a few common examples of temptation bundling 
 Only listen to audiobooks or podcasts you love while exercising 
Only get a pedicure while processing overdue work emails 
Only watch your favorite show while ironing or doing household chores 
Only eat at your favorite restaurant when conducting your monthly meeting with a difficult colleague 
This article covers some specific exercises you can follow to figure out how to create temptation bundling ideas that work for you 
 Option Make the Consequences of Procrastination More Immediate
There are many ways to force you to pay the costs of procrastination sooner rather than later For example if you are exercising alone skipping your workout next week won t impact your life much at all Your health won t deteriorate immediately because you missed that one workout The cost of procrastinating on exercise only becomes painful after weeks and months of lazy behavior However if you commit to working out with a friend at a m next Monday then the cost of skipping your workout becomes more immediate Miss this one workout and you look like a jerk 
 Another common strategy is to use a service like Stickk to place a bet If you don t do what you say you ll do then the money goes to a charity you hate The idea here is to put some skin in the game and create a new consequence that happens if you don t do the behavior right now 
 Option Design Your Future Actions
One of the favorite tools psychologists use to overcome procrastination is called a commitment device Commitment devices can help you stop procrastinating by designing your future actions ahead of time 
 For example you can curb your future eating habits by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in the bulk size You can stop wasting time on your phone by deleting games or social media apps You could also block them on your computer 
 Similarly you can reduce the likelihood of mindless channel surfing by hiding your TV in a closet and only taking it out on big game days You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online gambling sites to prevent future gambling sprees You can build an emergency fund by setting up an automatic transfer of funds to your savings account These are all examples of commitment devices that help reduce the odds of procrastination 
 Option Make the Task More Achievable
As we have already covered the friction that causes procrastination is usually centered around starting a behavior Once you begin it s often less painful to keep working This is one good reason to reduce the size of your habits because if your habits are small and easy to start then you will be less likely to procrastinate 
 One of my favorite ways to make habits easier is to use The Minute Rule which states When you start a new habit it should take less than two minutes to do The idea is to make it as easy as possible to get started and then trust that momentum will carry you further into the task after you begin Once you start doing something it s easier to continue doing it The Minute Rule overcomes procrastination and laziness by making it so easy to start taking action that you can t say no 
 Another great way to make tasks more achievable is to break them down For example consider the remarkable productivity of the famous writer Anthony Trollope He published novels works of non fiction short stories plays and an assortment of articles and letters How did he do it Instead of measuring his progress based on the completion of chapters or books Trollope measured his progress in minute increments He set a goal of words every minutes and he continued this pattern for three hours each day This approach allowed him to enjoy feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment every minutes while continuing to work on the large task of writing a book 
 Making your tasks more achievable is important for two reasons 
 Small measures of progress help to maintain momentum over the long run which means you re more likely to finish large tasks 
The faster you complete a productive task the more quickly your day develops an attitude of productivity and effectiveness 
I have found this second point the speed with which you complete your first task of the day to be of particular importance for overcoming procrastination and maintaining a high productive output day after day 
 III Being Consistent How to Kick the Procrastination Habit
Alright we ve covered a variety of strategies for beating procrastination on a daily basis Now let s discuss some ways to make productivity a long term habit and prevent procrastination from creeping back into our lives 
 The Daily Routine Experts Recommend for Peak Productivity
One reason it is so easy to slip back into procrastination time after time is because we don t have a clear system for deciding what is important and what we should work on first This is yet another example of the system often being more important than the goal 
 One of the best productivity systems I have found is also one of the most simple It s called The Ivy Lee Method and it has six steps 
 At the end of each work day write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow Do not write down more than six tasks 
Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance 
When you arrive tomorrow concentrate only on the first task Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task 
Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion At the end of the day move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day 
Repeat this process every working day 
Here s what makes it so effective 
 It s simple enough to actually work The primary critique of methods like this one is that they are too basic They don t account for all of the complexities and nuances of life What happens if an emergency pops up What about using the latest technology to our fullest advantage In my experience complexity is often a weakness because it makes it harder to get back on track Yes emergencies and unexpected distractions will arise Ignore them as much as possible deal with them when you must and get back to your prioritized to do list as soon as possible Use simple rules to guide complex behavior 
 It forces you to make tough decisions I don t believe there is anything magical about Lee s number of six important tasks per day It could just as easily be five tasks per day However I do think there is something magical about imposing limits upon yourself I find that the single best thing to do when you have too many ideas or when you re overwhelmed by everything you need to get done is to prune your ideas and trim away everything that isn t absolutely necessary Constraints can make you better Lee s method is similar to Warren Buffett s Rule which requires you to focus on just five critical tasks and ignore everything else Basically if you commit to nothing you ll be distracted by everything 
 It removes the friction of starting The biggest hurdle to finishing most tasks is starting them Getting off the couch can be tough but once you actually start running it is much easier to finish your workout Lee s method forces you to decide on your first task the night before you go to work This strategy has been incredibly useful for me as a writer I can waste three or four hours debating what I should write about on a given day If I decide the night before however I can wake up and start writing immediately It s simple but it works In the beginning getting started is just as important as succeeding at all 
 It requires you to single task Modern society loves multi tasking The myth of multi tasking is that being busy is synonymous with being better The exact opposite is true Having fewer priorities leads to better work Study world class experts in nearly any field athletes artists scientists teachers CEOs and you ll discover one characteristic runs through all of them focus The reason is simple You can t be great at one task if you re constantly dividing your time ten different ways Mastery requires focus and consistency 
 Regardless of what method you use the bottom line is this Do the most important thing first each day and let the momentum of the first task carry you into the next one 
 How to Avoid Chronic Procrastination With Visual Cues
procrastination
 Another way to overcome the trap of chronic procrastination is to use visual cues to trigger your habits and measure your progress 
 A visual cue is something you can see a visual reminder that prompts you to take action Here s why they are important for beating procrastination 
 Visual cues remind you to start a behavior We often lie to ourselves about our ability to remember to perform a new habit I m going to start eating healthier For real this time A few days later however the motivation fades and the busyness of life begins to take over again Hoping you will simply remember to do a new habit is usually a recipe for failure This is why a visual stimulus can be so useful It is much easier to stick with good habits when your environment nudges you in the right direction 
 Visual cues display your progress on a behavior Everyone knows consistency is an essential component of success but few people actually measure how consistent they are in real life Having a visual cue like a calendar that tracks your progress avoids that pitfall because it is a built in measuring system One look at your calendar and you immediately have a measure of your progress 
 Visual cues can have an additive effect on motivation As the visual evidence of your progress mounts it is natural to become more motivated to continue the habit The more visual progress you see the more motivated you will become to finish the task There are a variety of popular behavioral economics studies that refer to this as the Endowed Progress Effect Seeing your previous progress is a great way to trigger your next productive action 
 Two of my favorite strategies that use visual cues are The Paper Clip Strategy which is helpful for beating procrastination day after day and The Seinfeld Strategy which is great for maintaining consistency over longer periods of time
