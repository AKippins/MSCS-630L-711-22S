Hyderabadi Cuisine not just about Biryanis
Legend goes that the Nizam of Hyderabad had types of Biryanis cooked in his kitchen which churned out delicacies that were an amalgamation of Turkish Mughlai and Arabic influences blended with native Telugu and Maratha culinary traditions 
Hyderabadi food hence is much more than Biryani and Shahi Tukra Chef SK Saibjan who recently hosted an exquisite Hyderabadi Food Festival at Radisson Blu Paschim Vihar Delhi tweaked quite a number of recipes by fusing regular ingredients with flavors and fragrances from other cuisines In an exclusive chit chat with us he speaks about the Nizami food and what makes it among the most sought after cuisines of India 
What is the difference between Dum Pukht and Hyderabadi Biryani 
The Lucknowi Biryani or the Awadhi Biryani is cooked mostly in northern India Dum Pukht or Awadhi Biryani is called so because it is made in the classic style using a dum which basically means covering the top of the pot with flour dough This seals the aromas inside the pot 
Hyderabadi Biryani has been popularized by Kacche Gosht Ki Biryani which is made with raw marinated mutton cooked in between the layers of rice 
Burani Raita has garlic as the main ingredient Gosht Pasinde has beans and potatoes and you have White onion pudding also Are there other such wacky and interesting food combinations 
Hyderabad has a history of continuous influx of migrants from all over the world and in general from the Indian sub continent Most of the foreign food had been improved to suit the culinary preferences resulting to form the unique derivative cuisine that excels over the original 
Biryani Turkish and Haleem Arabic for instance are prepared all over India but the Hyderabadi variety has a unique and distinct taste So for that matter almost every Hyderabadi dish is unique But some special ones that need mention here include Jaituni Malai Paneer Tikka Qubani Kofta Paneer Tikka Zardaloo Tati Ke Kabab Murgh Ki Champe Tamatar Ka Halwa etc

What is the typical Hyderabadi breakfast 
Haleem Nihari with Kulcha Keema with Parantha Khageena Egg Preparation are the main dishes served during breakfast 
A lot of clarified butter and oil is used in Nizami dishes What do you have for the diet conscious 
One of the most important things to keep in mind is that fats and oil behave differently when heated When the oil reaches its smoking point a lot of the nutrients are destroyed and it can sometimes potentially form harmful compounds Ghee is a healthy form of fat if taken in moderation It has a high smoking point 
Also different oils have varying amounts of fats Polyunsaturated Monounsaturated and Saturated fats Canola oil which is made from the crushed seeds of the canola plant is said to be among the healthiest of cooking oils It has the lowest saturated fat content found in any oil It s seen as a healthy alternative as it is rich in mono unsaturated fats and is high in Omega 
Hyderabadi food tastes excellent when cooked in any medium as it gets its taste from the spices not the fat which is used 
Apart from Badam ki Jali with coin engraving Khoobani ka Meetha and Shahi Tukra names of some lesser known sweets include
Tamatar ka halwa Figgie Date and Khoya Burfi Mauz ka Meetha Banana and Milk pudding Gil e Firdosh Milk and Bottlegaurd Puddding 
Is it true that Sindhi Biryani originated in Hyderabad Can you throw some light on its history 
No Sindhi biryani is a special meat and rice biryani dish which is said to have originated in the Sindh province of Pakistan 
Sindhi Biryani is extremely spicy It is made with lamb yogurt fried onions and potatoes and fewer tomatoes Sindhi biryani also uses less food colouring compared to other biryanis allowing the rich colours of the various meats rice and vegetables to blend without too much of the orange colouring 
What makes Hyderabadi Biryani so special 
When talking about Hyderabad the first thing that comes to the mind is biryani and vice versa The use of mutton with a mix of spicy rice aromatic seasonings and clay pot cooking is what makes it unique 
There are basically two variations of the biryani The first is the Kachchi biryani and the other is pakki biryani where the meat is cooked before being layered between rice 
What is that one ingredient in Hyderabadi recipes which is common to most if not all 
Hyderabadi cuisine is basically a meat and rice oriented cuisine It contains a variety of ingredients that are commonly used 
ranging from vegetables spices meats flavors fruits etc In the city of Hyderabad and its suburbs tomato and tamarind are the most commonly used ingredients
